Ada Happy Hour is an app that I created for my [Ada](https://wwww.adadevelopersacademy.org) winter break project. I used [Jessica Lord](https://github.com/jlord)'s [hack spots](https://github.com/jlord/hack-spots) app as a base, and changed the project to something relavent and useful for Ada in the amount of time that I had.
